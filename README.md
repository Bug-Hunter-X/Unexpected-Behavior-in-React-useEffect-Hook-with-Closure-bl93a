# Unexpected Behavior in React useEffect Hook with Closure

This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook when using closures.  The issue arises from a stale closure value of `setCount` within the `setInterval` callback. This causes the component to not update the `count` state correctly.

## Bug Description
The `MyComponent` attempts to increment the `count` state every second using `setInterval`. However, due to how closures work in JavaScript, the `setCount` function inside the `setInterval` callback might not reflect the latest `setCount` function available in the component. This leads to the counter not updating correctly or even stopping after a certain point.

## Solution
The solution is to ensure that the latest version of `setCount` is used within the `setInterval` callback.  This is most reliably achieved by using the functional update syntax provided by React's state update methods.
